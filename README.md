Smart Responses: Uses conversational AI principles (e.g., The Challenger Sale) to handle objections, encourage engagement, and guide users toward scheduling a callback.
Callback Scheduling: Provides an integrated link to book appointments seamlessly.
Data Deletion Option: Allows users to opt out and delete their information via a simple SMS keyword.
Localized for East London: Tailored language and approach to resonate with the local market.
